1. My script is a student grade management sytem that stores students grades,removes them and also add new students to the sytem
2. When you run this script it will ask for username and password >>you can find them in the dictionary which is in line 2(admins dictionary)
3. I hope you will enjoy the experience and maybe this app will be upgraded into a school management system with a good UI
4. Watch this space for more!!
